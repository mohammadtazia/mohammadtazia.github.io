                <h2 class="heading" id="one">The Assembly</h2>
                <div class="paper">
                    <p>While the assembly serves as an amazing instrument by which students can express their beliefs, it suffers from two critical flaws: a lack of members, and an unevenly distributed amount of participation in <a href="about.html" class="inline-link">plank</a> writing. Luckily, there are several methods by which these issues can be addressed.</p>
                    <h3 class="subheading">Outreach</h3>
                    <p>The advocacy department will work closely with Chapter Affairs to ensure all active chapters either have assembly members or are making efforts to recruit. Strategies to incentivize membership, such as instructing chapter presidents to establish a position on their chapter cabinets for Assembly members, can be employed.</p>
                    <h3 class="subheading">Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>As a chapter president, I understand how difficult it can be to foster student involvement—-students often lack confidence in their abilities and may feel hesitant to participate. Thus, to combat this issue, plank-writing socials will be implemented to help cultivate confidence and nuanced arguments within passionate yet inexperienced Assembly members. These will differ from plank-writing workshops—-while plank-writing workshops help students learn basic information on the structure of writing planks, plank-writing socials would provide guidance throughout the brainstorming and drafting process, with live feedback from veteran Assembly members. <strong>This will foster participation from students of <em>all levels of experience.</em></strong></p>
                    <h3 class="subheading">Mobilization</h3>
                    <p>Due to its nature, the Assembly’s actions may inevitably feel a bit performative: while members do voice their concerns on real-world issues, there exists no opportunity for them to take action on said issues. Therefore, to cement the validity of the Assembly and engagement of its members, the Activism department should coordinate with the Assembly to plan initiatives advocating for ideas expressed in successful planks. If a plank calls for the protection of a woman’s right to an abortion, for example, initiatives such as a letter writing campaign advocating for reproductive rights or a fundraiser to raise proceeds for organizations focusing on promoting reproductive health could be implemented to address this sentiment.</p>
                    <h3 class="subheading">Community</h3>
                    <p>A sense of community is the greatest weapon against participant apathy. So, to bolster this sense of community within the Assembly, assembly socials can be implemented, bolstering the camaraderie between Assembly members and compelling them to get and stay involved.</p>
                </div>
                <h2 class="heading" id="one">Issue Caucuses</h2>
                <div class="paper">
                    <p>Issue caucuses are a wonderful opportunity for students to raise awareness towards issues they are passionate about, and I want to expand upon this aspect of JSA by allowing individual or sister chapters to host these caucuses during conventions. This would be a useful method in providing newer chapters with the organizational experience necessary to host successful chapter conventions, and could be incentivized through the provision of chapter sweepstakes points for participating chapters.</p>
                </div>
                <h2 class="heading" id="one">Student Involvement</h2>
                <div class="paper">
                    <h3 class="subheading">Outside Opportunities</h3>
                    <p>While the activism department and its initiatives are a great way for students to get their feet in the water, it is important to acknowledge that there are countless opportunities outside of the organization to gain experience in political activism. Thus, to provide an enriching experience for all members, efforts to secure internships, fellowships, and volunteerships will be bolstered by contacting organizations across the political spectrum.</p>
                    <h3 class="subheading">Student Insight</h3>
                    <p>A Google Form will be released in which students can input any specific initiatives they would like to see implemented, or any topics they want to see addressed.</p>
