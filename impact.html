                <div class="paper">
                    <p>I believe that activism and service go hand-in-hand: advocacy allows us to push our elected officials to correct areas of injustice or neglect. Meanwhile, service allows us to mitigate the harms of said injustices by providing support and relief to our communities. Thus, I want to see an increase in service initiatives as a whole. This can be accomplished by implementing a service coordinator position within the advocacy department. Similar to Directors of Political Activism, who focus on creating activism initiatives, service coordinators will be tasked with implementing monthly service initiatives.</p>

                <h2 class="heading" id="one">Volunteership</h2>
                <div class="paper">
                    <p>As the largest student-run organization in America, it is our responsibility to utilize our platform to help service organizations gain volunteers. With this in mind, the Advocacy department will take a more active role in finding, publicizing, and organizing volunteers for local causes such as housing authorities, soup kitchens, and beach cleanups.</p>

                    <h3 class="subheading">Accountability</h3>
                    <p>I believe it is well-within our abilities to hold our local leaders accountable, and thus it is our responsibility as an organization to do so. As a means to this end, the advocacy department will release monthly reports of how officials per area are voting and who they are receiving donations from. These reports could be publicized via Instagram and even included in Solis releases, and will make it easier to mobilize against controversial decisions by helping JSAers stay informed about their representatives’ actions.</p>
                    <h3 class="subheading">City Council Meetings</h3>
                    <p>The advocacy department will improve community involvement by working with chapters to coordinate organized attendance at city council meetings. In addition, the department will guide and advise chapters through the process of advocating during said meetings if they wish to do so.</p>
                    <h3 class="subheading">Budget Subcommittee Hearings</h3>
                    <p>The advocacy department will organize student attendance at California state budget subcommittee hearings, in which state officials review and revise how the state’s annual budget will be allocated.</p>
